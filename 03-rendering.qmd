R Markdown is designed to keep your source code separate from your output. Why? Because you will want to save your source code as a readable record of what you did. The source code can then be used to "play back" that record and (re-)produce the output. To be reproducible though, you have to first produce something---let's render this `.Rmd` to produce an output file.

## Knitting the source file

{{< columns class="twocols" >}}
{{< column name="narrow-left" >}}

{{< /column >}}
{{< column name="wide-right" >}}
The file extension `.Rmd` makes your file **executable**, which means that this file can be used to both save *and* execute code. Here is a code chunk:

````
```{r}`r ''`
1 + 1
```
````

Any output your code produces like tables, plots, or other results can be included when you render your document. This process is called **knitting**, because you are executing code and knitting the output back into the document. There is a special button for it in RStudio that looks like this: ![](knit-button.png)
{{< /column >}}
{{< /columns  >}}

NOTE: You may also use keyboard shortcuts to knit:

-   `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K` on Windows
-   `Cmd` + `Shift` + `K` on Mac

## The output file

{{< columns class="twocols" >}}
{{< column name="even-left" >}}
When we knit, R Markdown generates a new file that now contains four elements: 

-   Metadata at the top (we see the title)
-   Narrative text
-   A code chunk (but we only see one...)
-   Results (a plot!) 
{{< /column >}}
{{< column name="even-right" >}}
![](01-output.png)
{{< /column >}}
{{< /columns  >}}


## The output format

{{< columns class="twocols" >}}
{{< column name="even-left" >}}
This output file is an HTML document. This is a type of output, which was stored in the document's metadata block:

```yaml
---
title: "Early words"
output: html_document
---
```

Output formats are one of the most versatile features of R Markdown&mdash;you can use them to build web pages like this one, Word documents, PDFs, multi-page websites, slides, and even write books.

## What's next?

While this is a polished and shareable document as is, it is not likely that your work stops there---but it is a great place to start. Next, we'll show how to use R Markdown to develop your ideas alongside your code using narrative text.
