## What is Quarto?

Quarto is open-source software that helps you develop your code and ideas in one reproducible document. It is designed for anyone who uses code to work with data. You can use Quarto at any stage of an analysis project, any time you want to develop code and ideas alongside each other.

Start a Quarto project if you want to:

::: {layout="[60,-5,35]"}
-   Save, execute, and explain your code, all in the same place. Develop your code and ideas in one reproducible document.

-   Transform your code into polished and professional data products---reports, dashboards, websites, slides, even books. Knit plots, tables, and results together with narrative text, and create analyses ready to be shared.

## What is a `.qmd` file?

::: {layout="[50,50]"}
Every Quarto project starts with a Quarto file that has the extension `.qmd`.\
This particular one analyzes children's early words, but every `.qmd` includes the same three basic elements inside:\
- A block of metadata at the top, between two fences of `---`s. This is written in [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/). - Narrative text, written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/). - Code chunks in gray between two fences of ```` ``` ````, written with R or another programming language.\
You can use all three elements to develop your code and ideas in one reproducible document.

## How do I create a `.qmd` file?

Here is the plain text version of the same `.qmd` document, which you can copy and paste into a new document:

```{verbatim, file="fragments/doc.qmd"}
```

## What is **Quarto**?

**Quarto** helps you create dynamic documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures), and markdown-formatted text. In fact, in RStudio now, you integrate R code into your Markdown document and render as HTML/pdf/Word in the click of a button!

{{< columns class="twocols" >}}
{{< column name="narrow-left" >}}

{{< /column >}}
{{< column name="wide-right" >}}

The easiest way to install the **rmarkdown** package is from within the RStudio IDE, but you donâ€™t need to explicitly install it or load it, as RStudio automatically does both when needed. 

If you want to use the rmarkdown package outside of RStudio, you can install the package from CRAN as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

{{< /column >}}
{{< /columns  >}}

If you are not using the RStudio IDE, please install Pandoc (http://pandoc.org). Instructions are available on the reference site (https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

## What's next?

In the rest of this primer, we'll focus on using **Quarto** to create `.qmd` documents that integrate narrative text, code, and its output. While **Quarto** allows for many different kinds of output, we will use HTML documents. But the possibilities are endless ðŸ˜ƒ In fact, this book was also written in **Quarto**, and its full source is publicly available in the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/dspatterns/dspatterns-book>
