## What is R Markdown?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, Word, and Powerpoint documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
