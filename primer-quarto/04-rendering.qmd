# Rendering

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dspatterns)
```


Quarto is designed to keep your source code separate from your output. Why? Because you will want to save your source code as a readable record of what you did. The source code can then be used to "play back" that record and (re-)produce the output. To be reproducible though, you have to first produce something---let's render this `.qmd` to produce an output file.

## Knitting the source file

::: {layout="[30,-10,60]"}

::: column
The file extension `.qmd` makes your file **executable**, which means that this file can be used to both save *and* execute code. Here is a code chunk:


```{r}
#| fenced: true
1 + 1
```


Any output your code produces like tables, plots, or other results can be included when you render your document. This process is called **rendering**, because you are executing code and putting the output back into the document. There is a special button for it in RStudio that looks like this: ![](img/render-btn.png)

NOTE: You may also use keyboard shortcuts to knit:

-   `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K` on Windows
-   `Cmd` + `Shift` + `K` on Mac

## The output file

::: {layout="[50,50]"}

::: column

When we render, Quarto generates a new file that now contains four elements: 

-   Metadata at the top (we see the title)

-   Narrative text

-   A code chunk (but we only see one...)

-   Results (a plot!)

## The output format

::: {layout="[50,50]"}

::: column

This output file is an HTML document. This is a type of output, which was stored in the document's metadata block:

```yaml
---
title: "Early words"
format: html
---
```

Output formats are one of the most versatile features of Quarto&mdash;you can use them to build web pages like this one, Word documents, PDFs, multi-page websites, slides, and even write books.

## What's next?

While this is a polished and shareable document as is, it is not likely that your work stops there---but it is a great place to start. Next, we'll show how to use Quarto to develop your ideas alongside your code using narrative text.
