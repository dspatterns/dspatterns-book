*A Data Science Pattern Language: Designing Projects with R* is book that will teach you a set of flexible, reusable solutions to common data science problems. ^[https://maggieappleton.com/pattern-languages] 

We think of each data science project as a patchwork quilt: each project is a unique combination of patterns, but there are common patterns that resurface for every data scientist over and over again across projects, and can even recur in the life cycle of a single project. However, when you work with data everyday (and maybe also learning how to code as you work), it can be hard to see the common patterns, discover new patterns that you need to learn, and know the "good enough" practices for handling specific patterns that you encounter.

> "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."

> â€” Christopher Alexander

In this book, you will learn about common data science patterns. These are patterns that we have seen repeat in our own careers, across many different types of projects and datasets. In the past, Rich and Alison have needed to call on our memory, our colleagues, help forums, and sometimes our own past code (thank you version control!) to help us re-approach the same problem. Over the years, we have developed a healthy bank of pernicious patterns, and we have developed our own opinionated good practices for handling them. You will find these patterns and practices organized by chapter, which we have broken down into our own chapter pattern. This pattern is meant to help you see the forest for the trees, even if you feel deep in the weeds grappling with a data science or a coding problem.



*A Data Science Pattern Language: Designing Projects with R* will get you up and running with R. You'll learn many things in this book, with the main goals of enabling you to explore data, perform analysis on it, and communicate the results of that analysis. There are lots of little things to learn to get to that stage, but we'll take a patterned approach using a collection of R packages.

Why do this using R? Well, it has really developed into a great ecosystem of tools for working with data. It has had its origins in statistical programming but its ever-expanding stable of packages (i.e., collections of functions that help us work with data) and diverse user base has taken R far beyond its only-for-statistics origins. It's quite often the case now that if you need to solve a data problem, R&mdash;and a handful of packages&mdash;can help you do just that.

Throughout the book's chapter, you'll learn how to use R to gather, transform, and gain insights from data. We put together an R package just for this book, **dspatterns**, that contains custom-made datasets and some R functions that will be used extensively in examples and exercises. We'll make great use of this package to address challenges that are common with doing data analysis with data you'll find in the real world. We'll learn to make use of the *Tidyverse* collection of R packages to gather, tidy, transform, and visualize data. These packages are rigorously developed and are focused toward performing the core tasks of data analysis and reporting. 

We sincerely hope that you find the book gives you the skills to become productive with data using R (with a minimum of frustration). We always appreciate feedback and so you are encouraged to post any questions, comments, or suggestions you have about the book in the *Issues* section of the **dspatterns** repo. Your feedback is taken quite seriously and will be incredibly valuable for the development of this book.

R is a great language for working with data. Have you ever used **Excel** for data analysis work and wished you could make better charts? Perhaps you came up against problems with working with larger amounts of data? The lessons in this book will help to address those common woes and much more. We'll tidy and summarize tabular data. We'll make beautiful charts. We'll also work toward making those trickier topics (like working with dates and times, joining datasets together, and publishing and distributing our work) less cumbersome and much more understandable.
	
R has really come a long way! The large and growing ecosystem of packages (i.e., collections of functions that help us work with data) and diverse user base has extended the language such that it's not just about doing only statistics. R is, in fact, now very useful for solving a wide range of data problems. It's great that you're picking up this book and learning about what R can help you accomplish. As it turns out, there's a good chance that your analytical problems can be solved with even just a little R knowledge.
	

Because of the many user-created packages, R is now widely used in academia, industry, and in other organizations. R can be integrated into analytical pipelines, it is useful for ad-hoc data analysis, and it's highly capable in producing automated, reproducible reporting. Its plotting abilities have made it possible for individuals and organizations to generate and publish beautiful data visualizations. Of course, there are alternatives to R for working with data. Other languages include **Python**, **Julia**, **Matlab**, and **SAS**. All of those languages can, of course, help you to work with data. However, I think some of the key strengths of R (e.g., ease of manipulating datasets, great plotting capabilities, expressive and readable syntax, approachable community, etc.) will make the investment in learning R a great choice.
