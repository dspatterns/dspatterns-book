# Importing data for the first time

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dspatterns)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
```

In this chapter we'll get down and dirty with some messy (but important to use) data. We need to use this data and although we acknowledge the data is dirty, we can use a smorgasbord of strategies to overcome this.

First, we'll explore the data and find out what went wrong during the import phase. This will be a treasure hunt of sorts. Functions like `glimpse()`, `count()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and `get_dupes()` will be used during the first inspection. This will inevitably be a messy `.qmd` file but you'll leave it behind in your dust when you're finally able to diagnose all of the issues. (We recommend you save the file for later use and we'll provide a tip or two on how to organize these scratch files.)

## Explore

Getting new data can be really exciting but it can often result in a lot of work. You have to import the data such that it's not a garbled mess, you have to understand how the data is organized, and, you may have to do some cleaning and data quality tasks. The first few times you do this can be an exercise in frustration, involving much messing around until you feel you have a handle on things. That said, the goal of this chapter is to provide you with some workflows and many tips/tricks that'll serve you well when onboarding new datasets.

We'll be working with an Excel file called `stickers.xlsx` in this chapter. The dataset has a lot to do with sharing stickers and it's a really interesting one. The problem is that the data in its Excel form is a bit problematic (lots of messiness to overcome).

Provide a description of the `stickers` dataset. Add a picture of the dictator game (maybe sourced from Wikipedia).

Let's read in the file with the **readxl** package (with the `read_excel()` function) and have a first look at the data table.

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
read_excel("stickers.xlsx")
```

Okay, a few things stick out as being non-ideal. First, we seem to have an extra 'header' row that got into the table rows (as row 1). It contains notes and remarks about data encoding. We don't want that, so let's try using the `skip` option that's available in `readxl::read_excel()`. We need to provide some number of rows and while we can try `1` and `2`, they don't quite work (try using `read_excel("stickers.xlsx", skip = 1)` and `read_excel("stickers.xlsx", skip = 2)` and take note of the output table).

Because the rows to skip begin *after* the row with the column names, we'll have to try a different strategy. It'll seem a bit strange but the idea will be to get the column names separately and then all of the *good* data rows. First, let's get those column names, and we can do that with `n_max = 0` in the `read_excel()` call:

```{r}
stickers_empty <- read_excel("stickers.xlsx", n_max = 0)
```

This gives us a tibble with no rows, but with the column names nonetheless:

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
stickers_empty
```

We notice from this initial view of the column names is that they are none too good. One of them is incredibly long, for instance. Let's rename the overly-long name in column `12` with `stickers_given` and also use the `clean_names()` function from the **janitor** package.

```{r , paged.print=FALSE}
stickers_empty <- 
  stickers_empty %>%
  rename(stickers_given = 12) %>%
  clean_names()
```

The **dplyr** `rename()` function is very useful for all your renaming needs and we'll use it a lot throughout this book.

::: callout-warning
## The order of names in `rename()`

When using **dplyr**'s `rename()` function, we can rename as many columns as we like. The only thing to remember is that the new name goes on the left of the `=` and the old name is on the right. It might help to think of it as multiple assignments. If that doesn't stick, it's okay because we can look at the function's documentation with `help(rename)` (the key information about ordering is right at the top).
:::

These column names have been cleaned up by transforming them to `snake_case`, which are words separated by the underscore (`_`) character. Having long and descriptive column names is not really desirable in a data table. It's much better to have short fragments rendered in snake case (aim for less than 10 letters, if possible). 

::: callout-tip
## What's the deal with `snake_case`?

There are a number of ways to write out variables and column names. Why do it in `snake_case`? It's easy to parse the words/symbols of a variable this way.
:::

We'll print out the empty tibble again and have a look at the changes in the column names. It's *a lot* better now:

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
stickers_empty
```

Now, we're not going to put two tibbles together to form our final table. Let's instead pull out these column names as a vector of cleaned names, storing it in `col_names_vec`:

```{r}
col_names_vec <- names(stickers_empty) 
```

Now, finally, we can retry `read_excel()` with a few options in place. First, we'll skip over the first two rows of Excel data: the row with the column names and the non-data row. Second, we have the column names now as `col_names_vec` and we can provide them to the `col_names` argument (it needs a vector and that's really why we prepared one). Let's assign the resulting table to `stickers`.

```{r}
stickers <- read_excel("stickers.xlsx", skip = 2, col_names = col_names_vec)
```

And now, we'll have a look at the `stickers` table:

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
stickers
```

Not bad! All column types were guessed properly by the `read_excel()` function, so we needn't do anything on that. One column, `percent_given_outof100percent` has a bit of a silly name; we can fix that easily with **dplyr**'s `rename()` function, using the `ends_with()` select helper while we're at it:

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
stickers <-
  stickers %>%
  rename(percent_given = ends_with("100percent"))

stickers
```

Looks good now! Always make little inspections after making such changes to the data.

::: callout-tip
## Selection helpers in **dplyr**

There are so many ways we can specify, or select, columns in a table using **dplyr**. It's hard to keep all that in your head so a good resource for selection features is the documentation for **dplyr**'s `select()` function; it's accessible with `help(select)`. 
:::

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
stickers %>%
  rename(env = ends_with("abs"))
```
Let's look at our revised `stickers` table using the `glimpse()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(stickers)
```

Looks good now! Always make little inspections after making such changes to the data.

**Data Quality Concerns**

We need to acknowledge and accept our paranoia about data quality. It'll result in better work! And, let's constructively turn that paranoia into data validation checks.

**Saving Your Work**

If you did this all in a `.qmd` file (recommended) we suggest that it be saved to location with other scratch files. You're in a Project, right? Make a sub-folder called `data-raw` and put it in there along with the raw data files themselves.

Let's write the cleaned up tibble to a file for later use. Make a sub-folder called `data` and write a CSV using `write_csv()` from the **readr** package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(stickers, file = "stickers.csv")
```

## Understand

Now that we just finished some radical surgery on `stickers`, here's a question: did the fixing up solve the problem? Let's import the data from a `.qmd` that just contains the importing directives.

Now that we have data in fairly reasonable shape it's a great idea to put together a data dictionary. It's documentation that will help us understand the data, now and especially for later on.

We can do this easily with the **pointblank** package and its functions for building up a data dictionary. We do this with an *informant* object and that's created with the `create_informant()` function. Start with providing the `stickers` table to that function and then use a series of `info_columns()` calls to provide a statement for each of the 18 columns.

Make it possible in **pointblank** to use a tibble to get a basic data dictionary made with `info_columns()`. Allow for an extra column in the tibble to specify the position of the variable (this info should be combined with the description text).

tibble(
   ~name, ~info, ~position,
   subject, sldfjsl, 1,
   condition, sdlfjslf, 2,
)

```{r eval=FALSE}
stickers_dd <-
  create_informant(tbl = stickers) %>%
  info_columns("subject",
    info = "The ID number for the subject."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("condition",
    info = "Code from 1 to 4, where 1 = 12:1; 2 = 12:2, 3 = 30:1, 4 = 30:2."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("stickers_n",
    info = "Code where 1 = 12; 2 = 30."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("env_n",
    info = "Code where 1 = 1 recipient; 2 = 2 recipients."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("gender",
    info = "Code where 1 = female and 2 = male."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("age_months",
    info = "The age of the subject in months."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("age_years",
    info = "The age of the subject in years."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("age_groups",
    info = "Code from 1 to 4 where 1 = 3-4yrs; 2 = 5-6yrs; 3 = 7-8yrs; 4 = 9-11yrs."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("subjects_env",
    info = "How many stickers did the child keep for themselves."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("l_env",
    info = "How many stickers the subject put in the recipient's envelope to their left."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("r_env",
    info = "How many stickers the subject put in the recipient's envelope to their right."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("stickers_given",
    info = "The number of stickers the subject placed in the recipient envelopes."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("pct_given",
    info = "The proportion of stickers the subject placed in the recipient envelopes."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("given",
    info = "Did the subject give any stickers at all? It's 0 for FALSE and 1 for TRUE."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("l_env_n",
    info = "The larger value of `l_env` and `r_env`."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("l_env_pct",
    info = "The fraction of `l_env_n` and `stickers_given`."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("s_env_n",
    info = "The smaller value of `l_env` and `r_env`."
  ) %>%
  info_columns("s_env_pct",
    info = "The fraction of `s_env_n` and `stickers_given`."
  )
```

Once the data dictionary has been produced for `stickers`, we can look at it in the RStudio Viewer by printing it out.

```{r eval=FALSE}
stickers_dd
```

## Explain

More discussion on variable names (e.g., names as contracts - see Emily's blog post)

We got to make sure this can be done again. Let's take stock of what was done here.

How to manually generate a data dictionary (in an aside)

Never, ever edit the raw data file.

We can annotate the `.qmd` file with WHATEVER WE WANT. We can make a child doc where all the text will be hidden but the code will run.

A good practice is to include data validation statements after importing. Who knows, maybe the raw data will change and having the checks in place will catch a data error that crept in during the data update. This is something we can do with **pointblank** within a `.qmd` file.

## Share

We can build upon the **pointblank** data dictionary we made earlier. It's both great for you as an aid in understanding the data, and, others will certainly appreciate it as well! It can either serve as a conversation starter or a valuable reference that will be used again and again. Let's extend that file with more sections. Then, we can publish it or save the reporting as HTML.

Sometimes, you need to have difficult conversations with data providers. Sometimes they are great (i.e., they provide you with data) and other times they can ruin your life (i.e., they provide you with *bad* data).

Let's build a `.qmd` parent that uses a child `.qmd`. It's smart and we can break `.qmd`s down to components, if you will.

## DIY

It's now time to Do It Yourself. We'll recommend some dataset, give you some project ideas, steer you in the right direction, and you'll make something to be proud of.
