# Functions

```{r}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
```



Sometimes abbreviated `funs` in documentation, which is a little ironic ðŸ˜‰.

Functions can come from:

- base R (these functions are "built in")
- packages
- you


## Base R Functions

```{r}
seq(1, 12, 1) # base R
```



## Functions from Packages

```{r}
babynames |> count(sex) # count is from dplyr
```



## Roll Your Own Functions

```{r}
greet <- function(name) {
  glue::glue("Welcome to CS631, {name}!")
}
greet("Sloane")
```




## Function help

```{r eval = FALSE}
?seq
?count
```
