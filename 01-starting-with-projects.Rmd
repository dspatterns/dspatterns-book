# Starting with Projects

Decision: start with Quarto projects

``` {r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
```

This chapter covers

- Understanding our learning path for this book
- File organization basics; using Projects
- Where to go for help (app)

Notes: [ use this to develop a single project following the chapter pattern ]

- draw from: https://apreshill.github.io/data-vis-labs-2018/slides.html for organization of this chapter

We'll start with our first pattern. 

## Explore

- installing packages (`palmerpenguins`)
- introduce ways to inspect the `penguins` dataset: `head()`, `tail()`, `dplyr::glimpse()`, `skimr::skim()` (let's avoid the `%>%` for now)

## Understand

- explain how to access and read a help file (inspiration here: https://socviz.co/appendix.html#a-little-more-about-r)

## Explain

talking to yourself with markdown
- change Markdown reference to copy/paste-able text (use Pandoc divs for a two-column layout)

## Share

talking to others, if future thing doesn't pan out netlify drop
