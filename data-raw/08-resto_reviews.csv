review
Momofuku was our must-go-to restaurant while in town this past weekend. We made reservations several weeks ago on the first floor. We were sat right away when we arrived and greeted by our server shortly after. The service overall was very quick and attentive. My boyfriend was in absolute heaven as he has been waiting to try this place for a long time and we were not disappointed.
"Expensive. Food is good. Not great. $14 for a half glass of prosecco! Not a huge selection of noodles, especially limited if you don't like pork belly. Mostly vegatarian soup options, which I'm normally ok with but limited if you are seeking to satisfy the inner carnivore. Nice to say its been tried. But on to other gastronomic options. Many nearby noodle places by the way, much better value for the price."
"The vegetarian options are limited, but if you ask they are willing to create something for you. We ordered ginger noodles and squash soup. Those were good options. They are extremely crowded and the wait is close to 1 hour. So you should have a snack before coming. They have a jasmine flavored milk ice cream which we enjoyed, but limited options for dessert as well."
"Went to Momofuku on a Toronto visit with coworkers as we heard it was THE ramen place to try.  The food was amazing but my favorite had to be the pork buns; juicy and absolutely delicious! Considering the average, the prices are ok and service ok as well."
"As a solo-diner, I loved how fast I was seated by the bar stools, facing the glass-wall. Service was quick to get my order and was attentive enough to check if I needed anything else."
Sitting at the counter is where it's at if you don't have a large group. It's fascinating to see the chefs work to finish each of the dishes individually and seeing all the roles each chef/cook does. 
"I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars. Sure, it's a very westernized upscale take on Asian food, but the flavors weren't all that bad."
"I got the pork ramen and can understand why other reviewers said the broth was watery. Compared to other legit ramen places, momofuku's ramen broth tastes exactly like the soup packets you get when you buy instant ramen from the grocery store. There was a hint of sweetness and soy sauce, but the broth was very very mellow overall. But then, they never said they used shoyu broth or anything that would give their broth a rich flavour, they just said it would be a broth. So, if you don't try to compare momofuku's ramen with other ramen stores' ramen, this place is decent. Place is pretty chill, I went in shorts and was fine. Their menu wasn't anything special. A lot of the options were spicy and lard was a common ingredient in their sauces. "
The ramen here is your average food court ramen. The broth is very bland. I was kinda dissapointed considering how nice the restaurant is.
"Very friendly staff to start off.  We had reservations so it was quick to be seated.  We ordered pork belly buns to start off which were super tender and flavorful.   My husband got the pork ramen and I got the tsukemen.  The tsukemen was so flavorful and was the perfect portion size for a lunch and a reasonable price.  After lunch we grabbed some desserts from the Milk Bar for later.  That Milk Bar pie was amazing, tasted like toffee!  Wish I got more than one slice!   Perfect lunch spot for a cold and rainy day."
"I first tried Momofuku in New York City and I will say... I don't remember it being so expensive! My husband and I got one cereal milk ice cream, one hot cocoa ice cream, and three cookies (compost, chocolate-chocolate, and cornflakes chocolate chip marshmallow) and it cost us about C$30. Whaaaaat. One ice cream cone was about C$8! :O The ice creams are really good, but a bit overpriced."
"This place has a lot of hype and it lived up to most of it. This spot is an Asian noodle bar. It has things like ramen. However, they also have a milk bar on the floor above where you can get pastries and desserts. I got the szechuan chilled noodles. They were obviously decently spicy and they had flavor. I think the dish was good but I wouldn't try it again. It's a dish that you eat once and then try something else on the menu. I think it is a great summary of the whole place. Good but nothing special."
"The aesthetic of Momofuku has always been appealing to me, and I definitely made had full intentions to go! I was pleased to find that it was open late at night, and the location had a nice ambiance for casual late night dining. We were seated quickly on the bottom floor (noodle bar) along with a bench and table, which kinda limited the intimacy of the experience as another pair were seated right next to us. "
"We stopped here for lunch our first day in Toronto! Overall the food was delicious & very flavorful. We got the Black Truffle Ramen (it was the first day they had it back) it was delicious ! My husband got the Spicy Pork Noodles, I highly recommend it ! The chicken chorizo buns I would pass on next time but the pork belly buns I would recommend!"
I went to Momofuku for a work lunch with my team on a weekday after noon. We made a reservation for 11:45am for 9 with no issues. The table they had set up for us was on the second level right at the front of the restaurant by the windows and the metal sculpture; it was a really nice spot.
I've been to Momofuku a few times now and I was fairly satisfied each visit. The staff were friendly but it can get very crowded in the evenings. This is why I usually went during early lunch hours and got seats right away. 
This place is so hyped I decided to try it. Outside has a cool art piece. Once you walk in the confusion begins. Why are there four different levels? Is each level something different? Is one floor main dining while another is dessert? No one inside explained to me the differences. We finally got seated on the ground level and took a look at the menu.
"Came here for a lunch on a rainy weekday. Ordered the Miso Chicken Ramen. Sat at the bar by the window looking out into the rain and honestly it was perfection. Since I'm not a huge fan of pork, I opted for the miso chicken ramen. Good size and good flavor. I think the price point could have been better considering there are so many ramen dishes in Toronto but there's the name Momufuku to it. The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, I wish I had more in there. I also had a sparkling cranberry drink which was essentially cranberry syrup and club soda, refreshing. "
"Came here with a group of people to enjoy the large format fried chicken - half southern fried chicken and half korean speciy fried chicken.  The large format - for 8 people we each got 4 pieces of chicken, plus sides.  The sides were some sort of veggie slaw, sauces, and the a scallion fried roti (I'm calling it a roti as it best fits the description in my mind).  You can make wraps with the chicken and the roti!"
"In all honesty, I came here during the first month when momofuku just opened its Toronto location years ago and ordered a bowl of ramen and from what I recall it was an underwhelming experience."
"Always thought Momofuku seemed really amazing because of the beautiful location attached to Shangri-la hotel. But their ramen was just lacking something. The flavours didn't seem anything wow. Though the noodles had good texture. The bao,on the other hand, was really good. The atmosphere of the place was indeed nice, though a little loud, and they have a great selection of drinks."
"Dwayne was super accommodating and helped me made a last min dinner reservation for my fiance’s bday dinner.  We started off with white kimchi, it's pretty interesting, it's pretty much regular kimchi without much of the chili past and picked peach, refreshing choice.  "
"Momofuku Noodle Bar was very good. Quick service, yummy food! The bao's were great. No complaints here - this is a decent place for ramen for sure!"
"The atmosphere, the food, the service - it is all amazing. First off, all of the servers are extremely friendly and accommodating. We had a shellfish allergy in our party and everything was taken care of. The inside of the restaurant is very trendy and features long tables, some with benches and some with backed seats. "
"Excellent service, staff was so attentive. Food was generally good, portions were small. Cool vibes & liked the location of the restaurant, right next to the Shangri La Hotel."
We came on a Sunday for lunch and the place wasn't too busy. We ordered a shoyu pork ramen and a duck jigae ramen which was one of their Sunday features. The broth of the duck ramen was a little spicy and had some kimchi flavour. I liked the flavour because there was a little kick to it. I'd recommend if you like kimchi. The shoyu ramen's broth was a little too salty for me but the pork was cooked perfectly. 
"A first time at Momofuku for me! I had heard of the delights that awaited and was not disappointed. Interior style is trendy, with intimate lighting making this feel cozy despite the open plan design. We dined as a large group at a long table by the window overlooking the Toronto Streets. "
I just had to try the infamous Momofuku Noodle Bar! It's this chic restaurant next to the shangri-la with 3 floors of seating. I'd definitely make a reservation before coming as there was a lineup of people waiting to be seated. I was running late and had to push back my reservation- which I was able to do without any hassle! Great service :) 
"My first experience here wasn't amazing, but I had the chance to come back with a friend recently. We got to try a lot more of the menu, with recommendations from the wonderful general manager."
"This place is SO bad. If you insist on coming here on the strength of the Momofoku brand, despite repeated warnings from your friends who live in the area that it is REALLY bad, then just go ahead and make a mental note of where you'd theoretically like to eat AFTER coming here so you can go there right after because if you have had a chance to sample other ramen places in Toronto then you will leave Momofoku disappointed and hungry. "
"Despite the hype, wait time is reasonably low. The place is congested especially if you get one of those high chairs in the second floor. I have been to the NY restaurant & that was far better. I had ordered potato ramen & mushroom bun but didn't like either of them. No flavor at all. The potato ramen simply tasted like potato chips. The spicy shrimp noodles are indeed spicy & burn your mouth unless you're used to real hot spicy dish in daily life. Two stars for quick service despite the rush."
Got the spicy chicken ramen after hearing the hype of momofuku. $16 plus $3 for extra noodles. $19 definitely not worth it for this westernized version that tastes more like Chinese spaghetti noodles.
"You will definitely need a reservation for this place because it is packed. I got the pork ramen and chicken wings. The ramen was good, not many toppings to choose from but not too heavy. Good flavor of the broth, and the pork belly was perfect. I wouldn't recommend the wings, they had too much breading got my taste but I could have done with out them."
"Momofuku is well reknown for the owner/chef of that chain, and also because it is right next to Shan-grila hotel. I am always excited to go to Toronto for the food experience, because let's face it, they have better asian food than Montreal."
"I've been wanting to try Momofuku (and of course, Milk Bar), for so long & I finally got the chance!! I ordered the pork belly ramen, which was delicious. It was way too much food for me, but the guy next to me got his down in no time, it was quite impressive. I was being a bit reserved, since I knew I'd get dessert. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere & there's a beautiful sculpture on the outside (great photo spot). "
"I love this place. It has that boujie Nyc vibe with prices to match. Love the whole experience. Ramen is A+, chicken caviar is world class, milk ice creams deserves the reputation it has, amazing. I would also recommend this place for special occasions, they made my friend very happy for her birthday :) 100% id go back. Thank you for being momofuku to Toronto I appreciate it :)"
"Loved spending the first day of fall 2018 warming my tummy with pork belly ramen from Momofuku Toronto! I was treated to some delicious perks thanks to the Yelp Toronto team, including fried chicken buns with salmon caviar (not even on the menu!) and a gorgeous peaches and cream panna cotta dessert. It was all outstanding. I think the fried chicken buns and dessert were my favourite. Ramen was great, I just found the flavouring to be a bit too intense for me. It kept repeating on me throughout the evening, so it could be interesting to try ordering the extra sauce (orange paste) on the side to adjust flavour! My go-to spot is Konjiki ramen in North York. Overall, really lovely servers, super fun environment and a nice cozy menu to make ordering a breeze."
"I decided to give it another go despite the fact that my first visit to momofuku wasnt that pleasant, this time I brought a friend who really likes momofuku and I listened to the recommendations from the chef and the waitress, what a great experience. The service is great,  but the wait for some dishes can be long. We ordered chicken cutlet bun(there r two per dish), snow crab cold noodle, spicy rice cake and the glazed pork rib. I have to say none of the dishes above disappointed me, the fried chicken is extremely juicy and crispy outside which balances well with the plain bun, the snow crab cold noodle is covered by large amount of crab meat which is so tasty and creamy, I never liked cold noodles but this definitely changed my mind. The portion of Spicy rice cake is not big, but it is cut to tiny bits which is easier to eat, it is super crispy outside and chewy inside, I love the Korean ricecake and this is a great twist on it. "
"Whenever I want comfort or recovery food- this is my go to! I love their vegetarian ramen bowls; the pumpkin ramen is amazingly flavourful!! Their mushroom buns are fantastic! They have a nice rich sauce and honestly, I think they're better than either the BBQ pork buns or plain pork buns. Truly! "
This is a nice lunch spot for weekdays if it's not too busy. A lot of people recommend the buns here but I have never tried them. I like their Pork ramen which had a good broth and flavourful pork slices. I do find the menu a bit on the pricey side but it's not bad for downtown pricing. I always get the Cran-Blossom which is their sake based slushie. It's super sweet and yummy and complements the savoury (a tad on the salty side) food nicely.
